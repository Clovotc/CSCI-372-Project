In the test.py file, you will find all the tests to check on the funcationality of the YouTube functions.
There are ten tests in the file. Four to test the link validation function. Three to test the download mp3 
function. Three to test the download mp4 function. The link validation tests consist of the two types of 
youtube link styles while the other two test a bad youtube link, and an error youtube link. The three tests 
for both mp3 and mp4 download functions consist of a test for a good download, a bad download, and an error
causing download. If the test file is ran it should print out ten check marks.
